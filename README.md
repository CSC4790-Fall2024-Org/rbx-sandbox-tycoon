A roblox sandbox tycoon style game with the goal of promoting creativity, automation, and optimization while deviating from the linear style of typical entries in the tycoon genre.

We aim to create a dynamic way of generating currency and passive incomes to have the player create and use their own path on growing in the game. We are going off of another game: "Miner's Haven".
